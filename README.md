A project management information system (PMIS) is the coherent organization of the information required for an organization to execute projects successfully. This project is intended to develop a coherent set of functional specifications for a PMIS, dashboards and a Knowledge Management Plan. It started as part of the material of a master degree elective course but open to free collaboration.
